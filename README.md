## How to Use
1. Download the file and unzip it.
2. Create a directory.

```terminal
$ mkdir stock-portfolio-management
$ cd stock-portfolio-management
```

3. Check out the Python version installed. Ideally, Python 3.8.x is recommended in this project.
```terminal
$ python3 --version
Python 3.8.5
```
### Virtual Environment for Development
4. Virtual environments create an isolated configured setting for each project. In Python 3, a built-in module <code> venv </code> can be used for creating a virtual environments by running the command below.
```terminal
$ python3 -m venv venv
```
This command creates a folder "venv" that includes a Python interpreter and scripts for activating/deactivating the virtual environment. 
###### (You can also learn more about the importance of virtual environments in Python here: https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)


5. Start your virtual environment by following the command. 
```terminal
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $
```
